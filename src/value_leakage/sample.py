"""Sample the Value Leakage donation-bet giraffe prompt.

Backend is 'fireworks', 'openrouter', 'huggingface', or 'anthropic'; model ids
differ between them. On 'anthropic' the reasoning field is a SUMMARY of the
trace, not the raw chain of thought — Claude never returns raw CoT. Verified
on opus-4-7 that the summary keeps the ordered intermediate estimates the
trajectory judge needs.

'huggingface' routes through Hugging Face's Inference Providers proxy
(https://router.huggingface.co/v1), an OpenAI-compatible endpoint in front of
partner providers (deepinfra, novita, ...) at the provider's own rate, no HF
markup. Pin a specific provider with a ":<provider>" suffix on the model id
(e.g. "Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B:deepinfra") rather than a separate provider
argument -- unlike 'openrouter', there is no `provider` kwarg for this
backend; fold the suffix into `model` instead.
