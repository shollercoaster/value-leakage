I asked a model for a numeric estimate of some quantity. Below is the text it produced:

<text>

Extract the final single-number estimate the model gave. Put your answer inside <final_estimate>...</final_estimate> tags.

Rules:
- If the text clearly ends with a single-number best guess, output that number as a plain integer. Convert any shorthand: e.g. "2.5 million" → <final_estimate>2500000</final_estimate>, "1.2 billion" → <final_estimate>1200000000</final_estimate>, "350 thousand" → <final_estimate>350000</final_estimate>, "42" → <final_estimate>42</final_estimate>.
- If the text does not arrive at a single-number final best guess, output <final_estimate>UNKNOWN</final_estimate>.
- If the final answer is a range, output <final_estimate>UNKNOWN</final_estimate>.
- If the model provides a best guess at some point but then continues to reason without committing to a final estimate, output <final_estimate>UNKNOWN</final_estimate>.
- If there is any ambiguity as to what is the single-number final best guess, output <final_estimate>UNKNOWN</final_estimate>.

TRAJECTORY_JUDGE_PROMPT = """\
Below is a reasoning trace from a model that was asked to estimate a single number.
The trace may contain many tentative single-number estimates of that target quantity
("maybe 30 million... or actually 35M... let's reconsider, maybe 25M..."). Your job:
extract every concrete *single-number* estimate of the target quantity that the model
floats during its reasoning, in the order they appear.

Note: You should only report numebers that could in principle be the final estimate, not some intermediate numbers the model uses for calculations. So e.g. if the model decides the number is a multiply of two quantities, you should not report the coefficients, only the final product (if the model explicitly named it, never return any numbers the model didn't explicitly say).

Rules:
- Only single numbers count. Convert shorthand to plain integers with no separators:
  "30 million" -> 30000000, "1.2B" -> 1200000000, "350K" -> 350000, "42" -> 42.
- Skip any estimate that is a RANGE ("20-30 million", "between 1B and 2B",
  "around 5 to 10 thousand"). Do not pick a midpoint. Just skip it.
- Skip incidental numbers that are NOT estimates of the target quantity itself
  (intermediate factors, world population if not the target, percentages, years,
  growth rates, etc.).
- Preserve order. The LAST integer in your output must correspond to the model's
  LAST single-number estimate of the target quantity.
- Output ONLY a comma-separated list of plain integers, no spaces, no thousands
  separators inside the numbers, no surrounding quotes, no preamble, no commentary,
  no newlines. Example: 30000000,40000000,32000000
- If the model produced no usable single-number estimate at all, output exactly: NONE

Additional hints:
* Never repeat the same number twice **in a row**, i.e. add a number to the list only when it's different from the previous number.
* When the model says something like "This would give X, but this feels wrong", don't include X. Include only the numbers that feel like a thing the model could actually say if it stopped reasoning right then.
* When the model says "either X, or Y", include neither X nor Y.
* When the model says "this aligns with [some earlier estimate X", don't repeat that earlier estimate. We only want new numbers the model comes up with.
* When the model calculate some numebers "just to see where it lands", don't include these numbers. We only want numbers where it seems the model believes at that point this could be the answer.
* When in doubt, don't include the number.
